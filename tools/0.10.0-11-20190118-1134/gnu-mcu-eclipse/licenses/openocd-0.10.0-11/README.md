# GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD

The **GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD** project is a fork of [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org), customised for a better/more convenient integration with the **GNU MCU OpenOCD Debugging** plug-in.

Expect **GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD** to follow official OpenOCD releases, plus several intermediate releases, as needed.

## RISC-V support

After RISC-V support was upstreamed, **GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD** no longer
tracks the changes from the 
[RISC-V OpenOCD](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-openocd) fork, since
some of them interfered with other targets.

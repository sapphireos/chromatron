RUN NUCLEO EXAMPES
==================

1. Connect Nucleo F401 board (equipped with X-NUCLEO-53L0A1 expansion board) to the PC through USB (wait for the board to be recognized : drivers install the first time)
2. Program Nucleo FW : drag & drop .bin file from ApiExample\Firmware to Nucleo NODE_F401RE mass storage (Windows Explorer)
   => This FW will ensure Serial to I2C bridging from PC to VL53L0X
4. Double-click on any pre-compiled executable : vl53l0x_SingleRanging_Example.exe for instance
   => Ranging is displayed in the Windows console

The examples will automatically detect the COM port number to connect to Nucleo.
It is also possible to provide this COM port number manually through the command line like : vl53l0x_SingleRanging_Example.exe COM12

All the examples can be re-compiled using the associated .bat files.
You need to compile the API dll before : double-click on BUILD_vl53l0x_API_LIB_WIN32.bat file in ApiExample directory
It is assumed that GCC is installed and available in the PATH.

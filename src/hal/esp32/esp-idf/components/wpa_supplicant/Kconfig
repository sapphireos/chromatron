            Select this option to enable WPS related IOT fixes with different
            APs. This option fixes IOT related issues with APs which do not
            follow some of the standard of WPS-2.0 specification. However
            these do not include any of the security related bypassing, just
            simple configuration corrections. Current fixes under this flag:
            1. Allow NULL-padded WPS attributes: Some APs keep NULL-padding
            at the end of some variable length WPS Attributes. This is not
            as par the WPS2.0 specs, but to avoid interop issues, ignore the
            padding by reducing the attribute length by 1.
            2. Bypass WPS-Config method validation: Some APs set display/pbc
            button bit without setting virtual/phycial display/button bit
            which will cause M2 validation fail, bypassing WPS-Config method
            validation.

    config WPA_DEBUG_PRINT
        bool "Print debug messages from WPA Supplicant"
        default n
        help
            Select this option to print logging information from WPA supplicant,
            this includes handshake information and key hex dumps depending
            on the project logging level.

            Enabling this could increase the build size ~60kb
            depending on the project logging level.

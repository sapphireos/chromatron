Example of libcoap running on lwIP
==================================

To run the example, do

    $ make
    $ sudo ./server

(and in a second terminal)

    $ sudo ip a a dev tap0 192.168.113.1/24

and query `coap://192.168.113.2/time?ticks` with any coap tool,
or query `coap://[aaaa::1000]/.well-known/core`

This will

* download lwip and lwip-contrib from the upstream git sources
* build the server application
* run the server application, creating a virtual network device tap0 (unless
  that exists)
* configure your network interface to make the server accessible.

* return the appropriate response from the server to the client.

The server creates a resource for 'time' with a query 'ticks'.  This is
reported for `.well-known/core`. The work flow for adding more resources does
not differ from regular libcoap usage. If you seem to run out of memory
creating the resources, tweak the number of pre-allocated resources
in `include/coap/lwippools.h`.

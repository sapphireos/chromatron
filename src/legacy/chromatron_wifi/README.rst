Chromatron Wifi/Graphics Processor
==================================

This project is part of the Chromatron Wifi LED controller. The code runs on an ESP8266. Build system requires PlatformIO.

Run make_esp_firmware.py to build. This tool runs the build with PlatformIO, and then makes a few adjustments to be compatible with Chromatron's bootloader and firmware loading tools.

Note that while this code is currently built on top of the Arduino API, this is *highly* likely to change to a native build at some point in the future.
